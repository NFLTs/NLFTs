# Basic Configuration

Learn how to customize the NLFTs Protocol to fit your project needs.

## Configuration File

The core configuration is managed through the `nlfts.config.ts` file located in your project root.

```typescript
export default {
  theme: "dark",
  protocol: "v1",
  security: {
    encrypted: true,
  },
};
```

## Environment Variables

You can also use `.env.local` to define sensitive variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NLFTS_API_KEY` | Your unique protocol access key | `null` |
| `NLFTS_MODE` | The operation mode (dev/prod) | `dev` |
