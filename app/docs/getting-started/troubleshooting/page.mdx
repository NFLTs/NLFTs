# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them quickly.

## Hydration Mismatch

If you see a hydration mismatch error, it usually means certain components are using dynamic values like `Date.now()` without being wrapped in `useEffect`.

**Solution**: Ensure dynamic values are only accessed on the client-side.

## CSS Not Loading

If the documentation styles are missing, ensure you have imported the Nextra theme CSS in your layout.

```tsx
import "nextra-theme-docs/style.css";
```

## Module Not Found

If you encounter a `Module not found` error for Nextra imports, check that you are using the correct entry points for Nextra 4.

| Old Import | Nextra 4 Import |
| :--- | :--- |
| `nextra/bundle` | `nextra/page-map` |
| `nextra/server` | `nextra/server` |
