# Data Flow

Understanding how data flows through the NLFTs Protocol is crucial for building robust applications.

## Life Cycle of a Request

Every data request follows a strictly defined lifecycle:

1.  **Ingestion**: Data enters the protocol via the `Pixel` interface.
2.  **Sanitization**: Input is validated against its defined schema.
3.  **Transformation**: The core engine applies necessary transformations.
4.  **Distribution**: Processed data is sent to relevant protocol modules.

## Sequential Processing

The protocol ensures that data is processed in the order it was received, maintaining state integrity at all times.

### Example Sequence

```bash
[Request] -> [Bridge] -> [Sanitizer] -> [Transformer] -> [Output]
```
