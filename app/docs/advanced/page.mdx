# Advanced Guides

Take your implementation to the next level with advanced protocol features.

## Custom Bridge Modules

You can extend the core protocol by injecting custom bridge modules.

```typescript
import { injectBridge } from "@nlfts/core";

injectBridge({
  name: "custom-module",
  handler: (data) => {
    // Custom logic here
    return data;
  },
});
```

## Performance Tuning

To optimize the protocol for high-traffic environments:

1.  **Selective Hydration**: Only hydrate the components that require interactivity.
2.  **Memoized API Calls**: Cache passive data at the bridge level.
3.  **Turbo-Charged Rendering**: Enable Turbopack in your Next.js configuration.
